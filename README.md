Inclusive Crop Insurance Scheme Zambia ICISZ Mobile Application is an Inclusive Insurance Policy and Client Management Application for Android Smartphones. The application was specifically designed for the administration of the Inclusive Crop Insurance Scheme that is underwritten by Professional Insurance and Hollard Insurance. The Inclusive Crop Insurance Scheme is supported by FSD Zambia.


This application serves the purpose to support the quoting, buying, registration and management of clients and cooperatives of the Zambia Inclusive Crop Insurance Scheme. More precise, the application shall be used by insurance intermediaries to setup and sell insurance policies to farmers/clients in the field. The users of this application are field agents appointed by FSD Zambia, Hollard and Professional Insurance and their channel partners NUSFAZ and ZCF.

The application is designed to operate in a low network reception area and therefore requires manual syncing with the database as soon as reception is available. The insurance scheme was established through collaboration of FSD Zambia, Hollard Insurance and Professional Insurance.

The application includes four tabs, the first tab allows the user to quote and buy policies for a registered client.This triggers a text notifying the client about his purchase and payment request. On the second tab users can register and view clients. When a client is registered it triggers a text notification sent to the clients mobile phone. The management and registration of cooperatives and respective end-clients is facilitated by the third tab. The fourth tab allows the user to synchronize the data on the application with the database. It also shows a list of previous synchronizations.
